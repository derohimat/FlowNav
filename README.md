# FlowNav &nbsp;&nbsp; [![](https://androidweekly.net/issues/issue-397/badge)](https://androidweekly.net/issues/issue-397) ![](https://github.com/jeziellago/FlowNav/workflows/DEPLOY/badge.svg?branch=master)

FlowNav is a mobile library for Android that helps and provider a better way to make multi-modules navigation.

>The main purpose of this library is to help in cases where you have a project with multiple modules and need to navigate from one feature to another without adding dependency between them. For example, to navigate from module A to module B, you do not need to add module B as a dependency of module A.
>
>There are other ways to solve the problem of module-to-module navigation such as using Intent-filter (which is error-prone and not support fragments). FlowNav solves these problems, either using Activities, native Fragments, or through the Navigation Component.
